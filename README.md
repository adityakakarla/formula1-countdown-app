# formula1-countdown-app

Welcome! This is the code for the F1 countdown app I have created.

This web app is a simple app that uses the Ergast F1 API to display the time remaining until the next Formula 1 Grand Prix and shows the current driver standings.

This project uses React + Bootstrap on the frontend and Flask on the backend.
